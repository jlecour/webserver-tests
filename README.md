# Test Driven (web) Configuration

It's tedious and error prone to manually test the web server configuration (redirections, cache directives, SSL â€¦) so I've tried to the usual "Test Driven" dance, in Ruby.

This is a completely blank Rails app (4.2.1) with a test suite using 

- [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest),
- [Mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize),
- [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl),
- [Cipherscan](https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan/),
- [check_ssl_cert](https://trac.id.ethz.ch/projects/nagios_plugins/wiki/check_ssl_cert)

It's not tied to Rails at all, it's just an example of how it can be included in a Rails project.

To run the test suite :

1. replace `example.com` with your domain in the test files (`test/webserver/*_test.rb`) and in `test/support/webserver_helper.rb`
2. execute `bundle exec rake test:webserver` or `bundle exec guard`

You can set `WEBSERVER_ENV` to run the suite against a specific environment. I've been using **production** (default), **staging** or **development**, but you can change/add as many as you want.
